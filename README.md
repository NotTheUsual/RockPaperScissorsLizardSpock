# Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock

Small exercise for Makers Academy Week 7 to learn a bit about Javascript and testing thereof.

In this game you're presented with five options (the rules can be found [on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock). I swear I haven't made it up). When you choose an option, the site does the same, and then decides a winner according to the rules linked above.

All very simple, all used to familiarise ourselves with Jasmine testing (which is nice, despite Javascript).
